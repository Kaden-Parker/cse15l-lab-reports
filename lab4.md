To change directory I typed <c> <d> <l> <tab> <enter> since I was able to auto complete it. 
Then I typed <b> <a> <s> <h> <t> <tab> <enter> since I also able to auto complete it.

I then typed <v> <i> <m> <l> <i> <s> <t> <E> <tab> <.> <j> <a> <v> <a> <enter>. I used tab here to autocomepete the examples in the line then added the .java at the end since there were two ListExamples files. 
Once I was in vim I typed <43> <enter> to get to line 44 where the error was. I then when <right> 5 times and then pressed <x> to delete the "1" in "index1". I then typed <i> to get into insert mode. 
I then pressed <2> to replce the empty space I deleted previously.  I then presed <esc> to return to normal mode. I then typed <:wq> <enter> to save and exit the file.

I then typed <b> <a> <s> <h> <t> <tab> <enter> just like step 6 in order to test the file.
